    <p>The Slender Man (also known as Slenderman) is a supernatural creature with nebulously defined characteristics and abilities.
     Slender Man was first mentioned in Something Awful Forum's "Create Paranormal Images". 
     He generally appears (in modern times) as a tall humanoid creature in a black or grey suit, red or black tie, and white shirt. 
     His face is totally white, completely devoid of facial features. He has no hair, and generally has normal-looking bare hands, 
     albeit with fingers longer and bonier than a typical human. Slender Man has been depicted in imagery and literature at anywhere 
     between 6 and 15 feet tall, depending on the situation, though in video he is usually only around 6-7 feet tall.
      Because of his inexact nature, and differences between accounts, no one has yet determined what, exactly, the Slender Man is.
